Hi, Iâ€™m Pranav Shivam!
I design and develop AI-driven, scalable systems that enable intelligent automation, real-time decision-making, and high-performance applications. With experience in AI system architecture, machine learning applications, and large-scale system design, I focus on creating efficient and impactful solutions that bridge the gap between innovation and practical implementation.

From retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to AI-powered automation, I enjoy tackling complex challenges and transforming cutting-edge research into real-world applications. My goal is to contribute to advancing AI-driven technology and building systems that drive meaningful change.

Iâ€™m always open to exploring new ideas, collaborations, and the latest advancements in AI and system architecture. Letâ€™s connect and build something groundbreaking together!
